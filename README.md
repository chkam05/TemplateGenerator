NOTICE!: Sample templates are placed under catalog SampleTemplates.  

## How it works

The application runs on a specific directory structure that is placed next to the application runtime file.

```
ðŸ“‚ Templates
   ðŸ“‚ LanguageCatalog (e.g.: CSharp)
      ðŸ“‚ TemplateCatalog (e.g.: AspNetCoreService)
         ðŸ“„ template.json
         ðŸ“„ {ClassName}Service.cs
         ðŸ“„ I{ClassName}Service.cs
         ðŸ“„ {ClassName}ServiceConfig.cs
         ðŸ“„ {ClassName}ServiceExtension.cs
      ðŸ“‚ NextTemplateCatalog
	  ...
   ðŸ“‚ NextLanguageCatalog
   ...
```

- LanguageCatalog - Responsible for templates for a specific programming language.  
- TemplateCatalog - Responsible for specified template.  
- template.json - Responsible for template configuration.

### template.json file:

```
{
  "files": [
    "{ClassName}Service.cs",
    "I{ClassName}Service.cs",
    "{ClassName}ServiceConfig.cs",
    "{ClassName}ServiceExtension.cs"
  ],
  "keywords": [
    "ClassName",
    "Namespace"
  ]
}
```

- files - This node is responsible for list of files that will be copied to the project for which the tool was launched.  
- keywords - This node is responsible for keywords that should be entered into the template files, which will then be replaced with phrases entered in the application.

### Example usage in template code:

``` CSharp
{AccessLevel} class {ClassName}Service
{
	/// <summary> {ClassName}Service class constructor. </summary>
    public {ClassName}Service()
	{
	    //
	}
}
```

In this example, the keywords should include: AccessLevel and ClassName, that will be replaced by phrases entered in application.
